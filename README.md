This assignment's goal was to recreate an HTML web page and include three Javascript functions:
  Create an alert when the cities are selected.
  Change the text when Celsius or Fahrenheit are selected from the drop-down.
  Hide the cookies notice when the I Accept button is clicked.

This assignment is roughly analagous to a Yellow Belt Exam.
